This module is to demonstrate functionality and guide on how to create your own. 

Modules are determined by seeing if the folder contains this `info` file.

Each module is run with a `run.sh` script. In future versions, this will be made to be more generic and support other executable types.

Modules may also have a `config` file to set variables used in the script. When designing modules, they are read as:
<VARIABLE>:<DEFAULT_VALUE>:<DESCRIPTION>

The description is optional, but recommended.
